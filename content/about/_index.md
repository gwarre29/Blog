Hello! My name is Georgie and this is my blog all about the things that I've learned here at Mercyhurst University!

So far, one thing I've been blogging about is the things I've learned through my Data Science class. There were four major lessons we discussed that include: Histograms, Time Series, Bar Plots and Scatter Plots! For each of my posts I go step-by-step and provide numerous different examples! If you're interested in trying to learn all about Data Science, I suggest taking a look at all these posts! All you need is R Studio and this blog and you are all set!
