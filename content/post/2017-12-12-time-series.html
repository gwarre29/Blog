<p>Welcome to my first lesson on Data Science! Today we are going to be learning about how to make a Time Series! Just like with Scatter Plots, we need to download all of our packages and bring them in through library.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
library(ggplot2)</code></pre>
<p>Again, we are going to be using the baseball database in order to make the Time Series. However, for this example we are going to be specifically using data about one specific player, Babe Ruth. Below, is the query needed to extract the data we need.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>query&lt;-&quot;SELECT yearID,HR FROM Batting WHERE playerID=&#39;ruthba01&#39;&quot;

sqldf(query)</code></pre>
<pre><code>##    yearID HR
## 1    1914  0
## 2    1915  4
## 3    1916  3
## 4    1917  2
## 5    1918 11
## 6    1919 29
## 7    1920 54
## 8    1921 59
## 9    1922 35
## 10   1923 41
## 11   1924 46
## 12   1925 25
## 13   1926 47
## 14   1927 60
## 15   1928 54
## 16   1929 46
## 17   1930 49
## 18   1931 46
## 19   1932 41
## 20   1933 34
## 21   1934 22
## 22   1935  6</code></pre>
<p>Don’t forget to save it as a result!</p>
<pre class="r"><code>query&lt;-&quot;SELECT yearID,HR FROM Batting WHERE playerID=&#39;ruthba01&#39;&quot;

result&lt;-sqldf(query)</code></pre>
<p>Next, lets make that into a Time Series! The X axis will be “Year” and the Y axis will be “Number of Homeruns”. Make sure to name it as well, in this case it will be “Babe Ruth’s Homeruns by Year”</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR),size=1/2)+
  geom_line(data=result,aes(x=yearID,y=HR))+
  ggtitle(&quot;Babe Ruth&#39;s Homeruns by Year&quot;)+
  xlab(&quot;Year&quot;)+
  ylab(&quot;Number of Homeruns&quot;)</code></pre>

<p>We just successfully completed our first Time Series!</p>
