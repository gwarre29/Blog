      <description>Welcome back to my Data Science blog! In this lesson today we are going to dicuss how to make a bar plot! As always, we need to download all of our necessary packages and bring them in through library, as shown below!
library(Lahman) library(sqldf) library(ggplot2) This is the query that we need in order to get the data on total homeruns for MLB teams in 1980!
query&amp;lt;-&amp;quot;SELECT name,HR FROM Teams WHERE yearID=1980 ORDER BY HR &amp;quot; result&amp;lt;-sqldf(query) result$name&amp;lt;-factor(result$name,levels=result$name) Now itâ€™s time to add our own personal touch to our bar plot!</description>

      <description>Welcome back to my Data Science blog! Today we are going to be having a lesson on histograms! Just like with all of our previous lessons, we need to download all of our packages and bring them in through library.
Below, are all of the packages that we need!
library(Lahman) library(sqldf) library(ggplot2) This is query that we need in order to get the data on the weights of baseball players.</description>

      <description>Welcome back to my Data Science blog! Today, we will be disussing Scatter Plots. We are going to be extracting data from a database of baseball statistics in order to demostarte how to make a Scatter Plot. Remember, you must always begin by installing the necessary packages into RStudio and subsequently bringing them in with Library(). This includes Lahman, sqldf and ggplot2.
library(Lahman) library(sqldf) library(ggplot2) Now, lets take a look at this query I have below!</description>

      <description>Welcome to my first lesson on Data Science! Today we are going to be learning about how to make a Time Series! Just like with Scatter Plots, we need to download all of our packages and bring them in through library.
library(Lahman) library(sqldf) library(ggplot2) Again, we are going to be using the baseball database in order to make the Time Series. However, for this example we are going to be specifically using data about one specific player, Babe Ruth.</description>
